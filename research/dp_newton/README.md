# Project Title

Faster Differentially Private Convex Optimization via Second-Order Methods
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570 <br>
by Arun Ganesh, Mahdi Haghifam, Thomas Steinke, Abhradeep Thakurta.

## Description

Implementation of the optimizatoin algorithms proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570 <br>

## Getting Started
You will need to install fairly standard dependencies

run 'run_privacy_utility' to compare the convergence speed and excess loss of different algorithms.
